# Prompt 1

Read the attached requirements document.

Do NOT write any code.

Tasks:
1. Extract every explicit and implied requirement into a numbered checklist.
2. Verify the checklist against the document and ensure nothing is missing.
3. Identify ambiguities, contradictions, assumptions, and missing information.
4. Create a phased implementation plan with priorities and dependencies.

Output:
- Complete Requirements Checklist
- Validation Summary
- Questions (if any)
- Implementation Plan


# Prompt 2
Implement the next task using the approved checklist and implementation plan.

Requirements:
- Follow every checklist item exactly.
- Do not skip edge cases or validation.
- Keep the implementation production-ready and consistent.

Before finishing:
1. Review your own work.
2. Identify missing features, weak implementations, bugs, or incomplete areas.
3. Fix everything you can.

Only declare the task complete if every checklist item for this task is fully implemented. Otherwise, explicitly list the remaining work.


# Prompt 3 

Audit the implementation against the original requirements document and the approved checklist.

For every checklist item, mark:
- ✅ Complete
- ⚠️ Partial
- ❌ Missing

Identify:
- Missing requirements
- Incorrect implementations
- Edge cases not handled
- Logic errors
- Inconsistencies
- Technical debt

Do not modify the implementation.

Only report findings and provide an overall completion percentage. Never claim 100% completion unless every checklist item is fully satisfied.
